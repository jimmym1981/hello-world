MIS 250

Hi and welcome to my repository for MIS 250! 

Throughout this course, I learned to focus more on what the employer wants to hear when it is time for a job interview, instead of what I wanted to say. I was also able to create a cover letter and tidy up my resume by learning some new techniques and shortening a lot of my winded descriptions. Additionally, I was able to complete my Linkedin profile (which I had on the back burner for a few years) by adding my new skillsets and certifications to my profile.

Overall, MIS250 has helped me finalize some odds and ends that I had put on the back burner way too long, and that work has already showed beneficial in the short course of 5 weeks.
